# Unix notes

## Commands

* ctrl + u deletes the current line
* ctrl + d closes the terminal if there is nothing written
* p is like the old more
* pr prints as if it was a book
* tail -1 does the same as tail -n 1
* tail +3 prints file starting from line 3
* cmp finds the first that differs
* rmdir will only remove an empty directory
* `grep < file` does what `cat file | grep` does
* `nohup` does what ctrl+z would do

## Mail

* mail is quite useful for reminders
* write works like a chat, quite cool
